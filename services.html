              <p>India has been witnessing a startup revolution for the past few years and it ranks third in the global

              <p>In order to survive and grow in an increasingly competitive and accountable business environment
                organizations are required to report not only on their financial performance, but also their

                organization should embark on to achieve their business objectives sustainably. The emerging focus on
                the integration of ESG into business and making it metrics-driven is expected to create a long-lasting
                impact that the world deserves, where economic development and human priorities do not contradict but
